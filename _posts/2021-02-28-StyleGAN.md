### Overview

* Problem : While generative adversarial networks (GAN) based image generation has met rapid improvement in resolution and quality, the process remains unknown.
	* **Properties of latent space**, and other aspects of the image synthesis process is still **not fully understood**.
* Solution : re-design GAN to expose novel-ways to control the process.
	* **Starts from constant input**, and for each passing convolution layer, **adjust the "style" of image.**
		* Leads to automatic, **unsupervised separation of high-level attributes** (pose, identity) from stochastic variation (freckles, etc) in generated images.
		* No modification of discriminator or loss f.
	* Embed the input latent code into a **intermediate latent space**
		* Free input latent space from being entangled with training data.
		* Metrics : perceptual path length and linear separability.

* 지금까지 존재해 온 생성적 적대 모델 (GAN)을 사용한 얼굴 이미지 합성 기술들은 해상도와 전반적인 질에 있어서 가파른 발전을 보여 왔지만, 그 합성의 세부 과정들 및 잠재 공간 (Latent Space) 은 여전히 미지의 영역으로 남겨져 왔습니다.

### Style-based generator

* Mapping Network: 
	* Instead of directly injecting the latent code $$\mathbb{z} \in \mathcal{Z}$$, the paper maps the latent code to intermediate latent space $$f : \mathcal{Z} \rightarrow \mathcal{W}$$ $$ (\mathbb{w} \in \mathcal{W})$$
	* This can be viewed as a way to draw samples for each style from a
learned distribution.
	* The dimensionality of $$\mathcal{Z}$$ and $$\mathcal{W}$$ are the same (512)
	* Mapping is implemented with 8 fully-connected layers.

* Synthesis network (Generator):
	* The mapped $$\mathbb{w}$$ is then shaped to styles $$y = (y_{s}, y_{b})$$ for adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) which is applied to each layer of the generator.
	* This can be viewed as a way to generate a novel image based on a collection of styles.
	* $$AdaIN(x_{i}, y) = y_{s,i}\frac{x_{i}-\mu(x_{i})}{\sigma({x_{i}})} + y_{b,i}$$
	* Each feature map is normalized separately, and then scaled/biased from style y.
		* Thanks to the normalization, the style statistics does not depend on the original statistics, and modifies the relative importance of features.
			* Thus, modifying a specific subset of the styles can be expected to affect only certain aspects of the image

* Style Mixing
	* Mixing regularization : given percentage of images (90%) are generated using two random latent codes instead of one during training.
	* How? Style-mixing : At a randomly selected point in the generator, switch the latent code to another.
	* Prevents the network from assuming that adjacent styles are correlated.

* Stochastic variation
	* Stochastic factors (ex : hair placement, freckles) can be randomized
	* Previous : network had to invent way to generate spatially-varying pseudorandom numbers; consumes network capacity, and not always successful.
	* Solution : per-pixel noise after each convolution.
	* Noise only affects inconsequential stochastic variation
		* Spatially invariant statistics (gram matrix, channel-wise mean/variance, etc) reliably encode the style of an image, while variant features encode specific instances.
		* Since style features are scaled/biased with same values, global effects can be controlled coherently.
		* The noise is applied per-pixel, thus suited for controlling stochastic variation.
		* If the generator attempted to use noise to control global effects, the decision would be spatially inconsistent and thus penalized by the discriminator.

### Disentanglement studies

* Previous : given a training set with some combination is missing (ex : long haired males), the input latent space would have a missing space, forcing the latent space to be nonlinear and prevents from full disentanglement.
* Solution : the intermediate latent space is not fixed in the same manner, and instead induced by the learned piecewise continuous mapping.
	* Since it should be easier for the generator to generate images based on a disentangled representation rather than a entangled one, the generator forces the variational factors to be more linear.
	* Previous metrics proposed for disentanglement requires an encoder network which is unsuitable for STYLEGAN architecture, two new ways are introduced

* Perceptual path length
	* Interpolation of latent space vectors can show non-linear changes in the image (ex : new feature appearing out of nowhere from linear interpolation), which indicates entanglement of latent space.
	* Measure the level of change during interpolation in latent space:
		* Less "curved" (i.e more linear) latent space should show more smoother transition.
* Perceptual path length : weighted difference between VGG16 embeddings.
	* Given $$z_1, z_2$$ from input latent space, $$t \sim Uniform(0,1)$$, $$G$$ as the generator, and $$d(.,.)$$ as the perceptual difference between two generated images, $$l_{Z} = \mathbb{E}[\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}d(G(slerp(z_1,z_2;t)), G(slerp(z_1,z_2;t+\epsilon)))]$$
		* Total perceptual length between path = sum of the perceptual differences over each segment.
		* Epsilon
