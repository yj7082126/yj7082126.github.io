Most of previous models focus on object-level generation, which assumes a fixed orientation and bounded space for class of objects, and is totally not the case for 3D scenes (high resolution, unstructured geometries, diverse object arrangements, varying spatial extents)

LT3SD introduces a **novel latent-tree representation** , a hierarchical decomposition with a series of **geometry (lower freq)** and **latent feature (higher freq)** encodings that boasts a more compact, effective representation compared to single latent codes or latent pyramid.

Specifically, the target 'scene' is represented as a truncated **unsigned distance field** (TUDF), which is then passed into a encoder implemented as **3D CNNs** to give a low-dimensional TUDF as geometry volume, and a latent feature volume for higher frequency details. This procedure is repeated for N(=3 in the paper) steps to give a **latent tree of 3 levels**. For diffusion, a latent diffusion approach is used with a 3D UNet as its base. The inference structure allows a **patch-by-patch scene generation** (based on diffusion inpainting) and a coarse-to-fine refinement (adapting MultiDiffusion for speedup) to generate almost infinite-sized scenes.

The model was trained based on the 3D-FRONT dataset (6,479 houses), processed as UDFs with voxel size of 0.022m and random crops. The encoder/decoder training takes 5 hr ~ 1 day for single RTX A6000 GPU, and the diffusion training takes approx. 6 days for two A6000 GPUSs. Compared against PVD, NFD, and BlockFusion under various metrics, LT3SD (N=3) displayed better quantitative scores.
