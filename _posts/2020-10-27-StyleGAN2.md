## Overview

* We expose and analyze several of STYLEGAN's characteristic artifacts, and propose changes in both model architecture and training methods.
	* Redesign generator normalization
	* Revisit progressive growing 
	* Regularize the generator for good conditioning
		* Improve image quality
		* Easier generator invertibility

## Normalization Artifacts
* exhibit characteristic blob-shaped artifacts that resemble water droplets
	* starts to appear around 64×64 resolution, is present in all feature maps, and becomes progressively stronger
* Problem : AdaIN operation
	* normalizes the mean and variance of each feature map separately, thereby potentially destroying any information found in the magnitudes of the features relative to each other.
