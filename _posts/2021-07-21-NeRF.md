### Introduction
* By optimizing volumetric scene function using sparse set of input views, we can synthesize novel views of complex scenes.
* Input : Scenes consisted of continuous *spatial locations* $(x, y, z)$ and *viewing directions* $(\theta, \phi)$
* Output : *Volume density* and *view-dependent color* at spatial location.
	* Density : differential opacity controlling the amount of radiance accumulated by a ray passing thru position.
* Model : MLP, without convolutional layers.
	* Because basic implementation does not converge to sufficient representation, we use the following;
		* We transform the input coordinates with positional encoding, to represent higher frequency functions.
		* We propose hierarchical sampling procedure to reduce number of queries.
* Using traditional volume rendering techniques, we can project the output into synthesized images.

	* Limited by requirement of ground truth 3D geometry (ex : [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/))
	* Recent : relax this requirement by functions that allow neural implicit shape representations to be optimized through 2D images.

### NeRF Representation
* Input : 
	* 3D Location $\mathbf{x} = (x, y, z)$
	* 2D Viewing direction $\mathbf{d} = (\theta, \phi)$
* Output : 
	* Emitted color $\mathbf{c} = (r, g, b)$
	* Volume density $\sigma$
* Network
	* $F_\Theta : (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{d}) \rightarrow (\mathbf{c}, \sigma)$
	* In order to make the representation **multiview consistent**, restrict the network such that **volume density $\sigma$ is only predicted by location $x$**, regardless of direction.
		* $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow MLP(*8, 256) \rightarrow (\sigma, f.v)$
		* $Concat(f.v, \mathbf{d}) \rightarrow MLP(*1, 128) \rightarrow (\mathbf{c})$
